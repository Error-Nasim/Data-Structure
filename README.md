# Data Structure And Algorithm

## You Can Find The Truth In My Code _-_ NASIM


Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** Notes! ðŸš€

This repository contains a collection of all my implementations of various DSA problems and algorithms, which Iâ€™ve worked on during my learning journey. The goal of this repo is to serve as a central hub for storing, reviewing, and improving my coding skills, particularly in competitive programming and software development.

### [Complete DSA SHEET](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2) for ultimate practice

### Contents

- [**Sorting Algorithms**](https://github.com/Error-Nasim/Data-Structure/tree/85bfc10bbb8cbb2b65d76ae23c074a7f827b1cd4/SORTING): `Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, etc.`
- **Search Algorithms**: `Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.`
- **Data Structures**: ***([Arrays](https://github.com/Error-Nasim/Data-Structure/tree/main/ARRAYS), Linked Lists, [Stacks](https://github.com/Error-Nasim/Data-Structure/tree/main/STACK), [Queues](https://github.com/Error-Nasim/Data-Structure/tree/main/QUEUE), Trees, Graphs, Hash Maps, etc.)***
- **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: `Famous DP problems and solutions.`
- **Greedy Algorithms**: `Classic greedy problems and their solutions.`
- **Graph Algorithms**: `BFS, DFS, Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm, etc.`
- **Recursion & Backtracking**: `Practice problems with recursive solutions.`

### Why this Repository?

- **Learning & Improvement**: Track my progress and revisions as I continue to strengthen my problem-solving skills.
- **Code Reusability**: Implementations of key algorithms that can be reused across various projects and problems.
- **Open Source Learning**: Share knowledge and code with others in the coding community.

### Languages Used

- **C++**: Primary language, leveraging STL for efficient implementations.
- **Other Languages**: Occasionally, I might include code written in Java or other languages as well.

### How to Use

You can browse through the folders to find specific topics and implementations. Each file is named according to the algorithm or problem it solves, and the code is organized with comments to explain the logic.

Feel free to clone this repository and try out the code on your own!

### Contributing

Suggestions and contributions are always welcome! If you spot any issues or have improvements, feel free to fork the repository and open a pull request.
